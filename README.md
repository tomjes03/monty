0x19. C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO
In this project, we created a simple interpreter for Monty ByteCodes. The interpreter reads a bytecode file and executes the bytecode commands.
Aim for this Project
What you should learn from this project: Using Monty byte code file interpreter for stack and queue data structures

What do LIFO and FIFO mean
What is a stack, and when to use it
What is a queue, and when to use it
What are the common implementations of stacks and queues
What are the most common use cases of stacks and queues
What is the proper way to use global variables
